## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

Clarity is an open source project adopting the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.md). Use of the project and/or contributions to it must also comply with the terms of the license.

### Code style guide

Prior to submitting contributions in a pull request make sure your changes conform to the code style guide. We use [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to encoded in the coding style. You can find the encoding in the [.clang-format](.clang-format) file.

It is encouraged that your have ClangFormat installed and implement a pre-commit hook to apply the code style prior to submitting your code contribution.

In order to make it easier, we provide the [setup_clang_format.sh](setup_clang_format.sh) script that will configure the pre-commit hook for you. From the `clarity-android` directory run:

```bash
./setup_clang_format.sh
```
